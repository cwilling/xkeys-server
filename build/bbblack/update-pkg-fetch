# vercel/pkg no longer make updated nodejs packages for armv7.
# This matters because SFTV now requires nodejs > v12.x and
# there are no such usable prebuilt versions available.
#
# Since patches are available for v14 & v16 at:
# 	https://github.com/vercel/pkg-fetch/tree/main/patches
# we build & host our own modified nodejs packages (v16).
# They are used by preloading them into PKG_CACHE_PATH.
# However, to have them recognised there, the pkg-fetch module
# needs to be updated. We make the necessary changes here.
